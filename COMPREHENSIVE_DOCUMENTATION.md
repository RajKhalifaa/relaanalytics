    # Key Features:
    # - Authentic Malaysian names by ethnicity (Malay, Chinese, Indian)
    # - Valid Malaysian IC numbers with state birth codes
    # - Realistic phone numbers (80% mobile, 20% landline)
    # - Performance correlation with experience and rank
    # - Training counts based on years of service
```

**Data Fields Generated:**

#### Operations Generation Process
```python
def generate_operations_data(self, num_operations=50000):
    # Creates realistic RELA operations with Malaysian context
    # Complexity-based resource allocation
    # Weather impact on success rates
    # Time-of-day effects on response rates
```

- **Complexity Levels**: Low (40%), Medium (35%), High (20%), Critical (5%)
- **Success Rate Modifiers**: 
  - Weather: Clear (+5%), Rainy (-8%), Stormy (-15%)
  - Duration: Longer operations have lower success rates
  - Complexity: Higher complexity reduces success rates
- **Resource Allocation**: Volunteers, budget, equipment based on complexity

#### Assignment Generation Process
```python
def generate_assignments_data(self, members_df, operations_df, num_assignments=200000):
    # Links members to operations with realistic patterns
    # Performance scoring based on member characteristics
    # Feedback correlation with assignment outcomes
```

**Assignment Logic:**

**Fixed by**:
```python
# Clean data: remove NaN values and ensure valid ranges
perf_training_clean = perf_training.dropna(subset=['training_completed', 'performance_score'])
perf_training_clean = perf_training_clean[
    (perf_training_clean['training_completed'] >= 0) &
