- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for government-style appearance with Malaysian branding
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar for filtering and navigation

### Backend Architecture
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- **Synthetic Data**: Faker library with Malaysian locale for realistic test data
- **Analytics Engine**: Custom Analytics class for data filtering and processing
- **Dashboard Engine**: Modular Dashboard class for visualization components

### Data Architecture
- **Data Storage**: In-memory DataFrames (no persistent database)
- **Data Generation**: Real-time synthetic data generation with Malaysian context
- **Data Models**: Three main entities - Members, Operations, and Assignments

## Key Components

### 1. Data Generator (`data_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generates realistic Malaysian RELA data for testing and demonstration
- **Features**: 
  - Malaysian states and districts mapping
  - RELA-specific operation types and ranks
  - Realistic member profiles with Malaysian names and locations
  - Time-based operation and assignment data

### 2. Analytics Engine (`analytics.py`)
- **Purpose**: Provides data filtering and analysis capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Multi-dimensional filtering (states, status, date ranges)
  - Cross-dataset filtering maintaining data relationships
  - Scalable filtering architecture for future enhancements

### 3. Dashboard System (`dashboard.py`)
- **Purpose**: Renders interactive visualizations and metrics
- **Features**:
  - Executive overview with KPIs
  - Interactive charts using Plotly
  - Government-style color scheme and branding
  - Modular component architecture

### 4. Main Application (`app.py`)
- **Purpose**: Entry point and overall application orchestration
- **Features**:
  - Streamlit configuration and page setup
  - Custom CSS styling for professional appearance
  - Component integration and routing

## Data Flow

1. **Data Generation**: DataGenerator creates synthetic Malaysian RELA data
2. **Data Processing**: Analytics engine filters and processes data based on user selections
3. **Visualization**: Dashboard components render processed data into interactive charts
4. **User Interaction**: Streamlit handles user inputs and triggers data updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations

### Data Generation
- **Faker**: Synthetic data generation with Malaysian locale support

### Utility Libraries
- **datetime**: Date and time handling
- **json**: Data serialization (minimal usage)
- **random**: Random number generation for synthetic data

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Platform**: Replit-ready Python application
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies installable via pip
- **Runtime**: Pure Python with no external database requirements

### Scalability Considerations
- **Database Integration**: Architecture supports future database integration
- **Authentication**: Modular design allows for future auth implementation
- **Performance**: In-memory processing suitable for demonstration, can be enhanced for production

### Malaysian Context
- **Localization**: Malaysian states, districts, and cultural context
- **Government Styling**: Professional appearance suitable for government use
- **RELA-Specific**: Tailored for Malaysian People's Volunteer Corps operations

The application is designed to be easily extensible, with clear separation of concerns between data generation, analysis, and visualization components. The synthetic data approach allows for comprehensive testing without requiring real sensitive data.
