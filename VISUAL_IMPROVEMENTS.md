# RELA Malaysia Background Image Setup

## To add the ceremonial background image:

1. Save the RELA Malaysia ceremonial image (from the screenshot) as `rela_background.jpg` in the `assets/` folder
2. The image should show the RELA personnel formation ceremony
3. The image will automatically appear as the background behind the "RELA MALAYSIA" header
4. The gradient overlay ensures text remains readable

## Current improvements made:

### 1. Enhanced Header Design:

- Added background image support for the RELA MALAYSIA title section
- Improved typography with better shadows and spacing

### 2. Metric Boxes Enhancement:

- Replaced simple st.metric with custom styled boxes
- Added hover effects for better interactivity
- Included colored left border for visual distinction
- Enhanced typography with better color hierarchy
- Added subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size

### 3. Visual Improvements:

- Better color scheme consistency
- Improved spacing and padding
- Enhanced accessibility with better contrast

- Professional government-style appearance

## File Changes Made:

- `app.py`: Updated render_header() function with background image support
- `src/core/dashboard.py`: Enhanced KPI metrics with custom styling
- `assets/`: Added placeholder for background image

## Next Steps:

1. Add the actual ceremonial image as `assets/rela_background.jpg`
2. The image should be high resolution (recommended: 1920x800px or similar)
3. Ensure the image shows RELA Malaysia personnel in formation
4. The system will automatically apply the overlay and styling
